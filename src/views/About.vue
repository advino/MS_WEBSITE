                The future of live events lies in the ability for the auidence to play a role in shaping the event's experience.
                <br />
                <br />
                <!-- Our phones have given us the ability to document, share, and respond to a myriad of real-time events through a variety of platforms.
                <br />
                <br /> -->
                We asked ourselves if there was a way that the vast expanse of data emitted at these events could create a feedback loop in which technology provided a medium by which the auidence could augment their experience rather than just document it.
                <br />
                <br />

                And so Mixed Signals was created.
